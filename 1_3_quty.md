# 1.3. Using the QUTy Development Board

The QUTy Development Board is a circuit board fitted with the Microchip
ATtiny1626 AVR microcontroller. This board supports two modes through
it's USB-C interface:

- Programming through the Unified Program and Debug Interface (UPDI)
- Serial communication through the Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)

UPDI is used for programming and debugging the ATtiny1626
microcontroller. It allows direct access to SRAM, registers, flash,
EEPROM, USERROW, SIGROW, and other fuses.

UART facilitates serial communication between the QUTy board and a host
machine, enabling data exchange during program execution.

## Programming through UPDI

Upon successfully building a project using PlatformIO, the
QUTy platform emits a `firmware.hex` file to the `.pio/build/QUTy/`
directory. This file can be uploaded to the ATtiny1626 using the UPDI
interface on the QUTy board.

This is can done in one of two ways:

- Using the PlatformIO interface
- Using the `pymcuprog` utility

### Uploading Firmware using PlatformIO

1. Connect the QUTy board to the host machine using a USB-C cable.
2. Place the slide switch **S6** on the QUTy board in the UPDI position (left).
3. Upload the firmware using the PlatformIO interface.

A successful upload will result in the following output:

```txt

CURRENT: upload_protocol = updi

```

### Uploading Firmware using `pymcuprog`

1. Connect the QUTy board to the host machine using a USB-C cable.
2. Place the slide switch **S6** on the QUTy board in the UPDI position (left).
3. Execute the following command to erase the device:

   ```txt
   # pymcuprog erase -t uart -u <device-port> -d attiny1626
   ```

   A successful erase will result in the following output:

   ```txt
   Connecting to SerialUPDI
   Pinging device...
   Ping response: 1E9429
   Chip/Bulk erase:
   - Memory type eeprom is conditionally erased (depending upon EESAVE fuse setting)
   - Memory type flash is always erased
   - Memory type lockbits is always erased
   Erased.
   Done.
   ```

4. Execute the following command to upload the firmware:

   ```txt
   # pymcuprog write -t uart -u <device-port> -d attiny1626 -f .pio/build/QUTy/firmware.hex
   ```

   A successful upload will result in the following output:

   ```txt
   Connecting to SerialUPDI
   Pinging device...
   Ping response: 1E9429
   Writing from hex file...
   Writing flash...
   Done.
   ```

## Serial Communication through UART

*Ensure firmware has been uploaded to the QUTy board before reading this section.*

To allow serial communication between the QUTy board and the host
machine:

1. Connect the QUTy board to the host machine using a USB-C cable.
2. Place the slide switch **S6** on the QUTy board in the UART position (right).
3. Open the serial monitor in PlatformIO or use a serial terminal program
   to communicate with the QUTy board, ensuring the UART protocol is
   configured appropriately. By default, the ATtiny1626 uses 9600&mdash;8N1:

   - Baud rate: 9600 bps
   - Data bits: 8 bits
   - Parity: None
   - Stop bits: 1 bit
4. Restart the QUTy board using pushbutton **S5** to restart program
   execution, allowing transmitted data to be received by the host
   machine.
